    * btests: improving on the already made results by estimating it and only
    save if the new results is better
    * btests: limit of generations to 2000

    * Changelog: started to document changes
    * runtest: reading function names
    * runtest: removing average for better convergence of identification and
    adding it later (std should be removed ad well?)
    * runtest: checking for zero variance
    * genalg: 3rd order filter instead of 2nd
    * genalg: minimum and maximum limit check (commented out)
    * genalg: some improvements in the random values for better convergence
    * filtval: tried mean, but sum works better
    * functnames: reading all the function names and plotting a graph
    * atests: for testing the dataset a
